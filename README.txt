This repository contains the necessary files for a radio application built for the Algoritmos y 
Estructuras de datos course.

The needed files are:

*Main.java the main method which runs the radio.
*Radio.java the interface of the project.
*MaquinaRadio.java which contains the necessary methods to run the radio.
*MaquinaRadioTest.java code used to test methods with Junit. In case you don't have Junit, disregard this file. 
*RadioGUI.form the design of the UI
*RadioGUI.java buttons, labels, and actions used in the buttons

There's a video calles MatrixRadioVideo which shows the functionalities present in the radio.
